1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  This can be accessed by the at method on line 21. Developers can also use the insert method, being able to add a pixel within the provided constraints (R,G,B, 0-255).

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  The at method shows what is located in each coordinate, but we could also write a specific loop that iterates through the values and prints that information to the user.


3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  This is effectively adding another layer of depth to the line problem. Anything planar can be represented with this structure - the global positioning system, for instance, relies on mapping the Earth into a two dimensional plane and using coordinates to represent locations(elements).
