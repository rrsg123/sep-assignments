Between my three models, bucket sort seems to be the quickest. I'm not sure if this has to do with the simplicity of the model, perhaps redundancies I could avoid, or the type altogether. 

After testing with a size of 500, 5000, and 50000 as well, I can see that bucket sort becomes even quicker by comparison. It seems that this works on the same principle as a binary search - once the collection gets larger, it makes more sense to split it up for a quicker operation.
